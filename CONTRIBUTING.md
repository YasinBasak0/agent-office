# Contributing to Agent Office

Thanks for helping. Issues and pull requests are welcome, small ones especially.

## Layout

| Folder | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | The Electron app for macOS, Linux and Windows: `main.js` (window, ptys, accounts, notifications), `preload.js` (the `window.agentOffice` bridge), `renderer/` (sidebar, terminals, agent panel), `src/` (pure logic, tested with `node --test`) |
| `plugin/` | The Claude Code plugin: `hooks/register.tsx` writes each session's state file; `viewer/office.mjs` draws the office in a terminal |
| `plugin/viewer/core.mjs` | **The** office renderer, shared by both. `app/src/office/core.mjs` is a copy: edit the plugin file, then run `node app/scripts/sync-core.mjs` (`npm start` and `npm run dist` do it for you) |
| `app/CONTRACT.md` | How the parts talk: the session file format, the `window.agentOffice` API, the office data. Update it when you change an interface |

## Run and test

```sh
cd app && npm install && npm start      # the app from source
node --test app/test/main.test.cjs       # main process logic
node --test app/test/windows.test.cjs    # Windows-only checks (skipped elsewhere; CI's windows-build runs them)
node --test app/test/locales.test.mjs    # locale files: same keys and placeholders, every key used in code exists
node app/test/office.test.mjs            # office renderer and session reading
node app/test/visual.test.mjs            # office pictures; UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 to accept a deliberate change
claude plugin test plugin                # plugin hooks (Claude Code 2.1.295 or newer)
node --test plugin/tests/viewer-smoke.mjs
npx -p typescript@5.6.3 tsc -p app       # type-check (needs app/node_modules)
npx -y eslint@9 .                        # lint (eslint.config.mjs: recommended rules only, no formatting)
```

The renderer also opens in a plain browser with a fake backend: serve `app/` with any static server and open `/renderer/index.html` (`?lang=en`, `?asking`, `?select=m-1`, `?platform=linux` or `win32`, `?theme=sakura` and more, see the top of `renderer/dev-mock.js`). The theme gallery is read from `themes/`, so for it serve the repository root and open `/app/renderer/index.html`.

Linux packages: `cd app && npm install && npm run dist:linux` on a Linux machine (node-pty is compiled from source there: `python3`, `make`, a C++ compiler). CI's `linux-build` job does the same on every push and keeps the AppImage and `.deb` as artifacts.

Windows installer: `cd app && npm install && npm run dist:win` (on Windows, or cross-built on macOS/Linux). It uses `scripts/win-builder-config.cjs`, which is package.json's build config with node-pty's win32-x64 prebuild let in (macOS and Linux packages leave every win32 prebuild out). CI's `windows-build` job builds it on every push, runs the Windows-only tests and starts a command through node-pty's ConPTY inside the packaged app. Nobody can run the Windows app in CI, so changes to the Windows paths in `main.js` need a try on a real Windows machine.

CI runs all of this on every push and pull request.

## Conventions

- **Strings**: every user-visible string of the app is in `app/locales/en.json` and `app/locales/tr.json`, read with `t('namespace.key', { var })` (renderer: `renderer/i18n.js`; main: `T(...)` in `main.js`). Add a new string to every locale file; `app/test/locales.test.mjs` fails otherwise. The words drawn in the office (`STRINGS` in `plugin/viewer/core.mjs`) and the plugin's hook messages are separate and stay in their files.
- **Comments** are in English (the user-visible strings stay bilingual, see Strings above).
- **No new runtime dependencies** without a good reason; the plugin has none at all.
- **Platforms**: macOS, Linux and (new) Windows. Keep differences behind small `process.platform` checks: pure helpers in `app/src/platform.js` (default shell, Linux and Windows clipboard files, menu shortcuts, finding and starting `claude` on Windows, Git Bash), `app/src/usage.js` (the Windows status line), `src/terminal-keys.mjs` (image paste key, path quoting), and in the renderer `renderer/platform.js` (`platform-darwin` / `platform-linux` / `platform-win32` class on `<html>`, ⌘ vs Ctrl+Shift shortcuts). Pass the platform and environment in as arguments so the tests cover every OS on any OS. macOS behaviour must not change when you touch Linux or Windows code, and the other way round.
- Keep `app/CONTRACT.md` and the READMEs in step with what you change.

## Adding a translation

1. Copy `app/locales/en.json` to `app/locales/<code>.json` (a language code: `de`, `fr`, `pt-BR`) and translate the values. Set `"_name"` to the language's name in that language (`"Deutsch"`): that is what the sidebar's language picker shows. Nothing else needs registering: the picker and the "Auto" (system language) setting list the files in `app/locales/`.
2. Keep the keys and the `{placeholders}` as they are; you can move a placeholder within the sentence. Plurals are objects with CLDR categories (`"one"`, `"few"`, `"many"`, `"other"`, ...; `"other"` is required) chosen by `{n}` with `Intl.PluralRules` for your language, e.g. `{ "one": "1 tool call", "other": "{n} tool calls" }`; if your language does not change the word, a plain string is fine.
3. Run `node --test app/test/locales.test.mjs` (same keys and placeholders as `en.json`). To see it, open the renderer in a browser with the fake backend: `/renderer/index.html?lang=<code>&langs=en,tr,<code>`.

A missing key falls back to English. The office's drawn words (boss, waiting, today...) come in English and Turkish only (`STRINGS` in `plugin/viewer/core.mjs`); with any other language the office uses English.

## Adding a theme to the gallery

1. Add `themes/<name>.json`: a `themes.json` fragment with one key, `{ "<name>": { "description": "<one line>", "match": "<name>", "sign": "<NAME>", "colors": { ... } } }`. The colour keys are those of `C` in `plugin/viewer/core.mjs` (`#rrggbb`); look at an existing theme for the ones that cover the walls, floors, desks, chairs, sign and bots.
2. Draw the preview: `node plugin/viewer/gallery.mjs <name>` writes `themes/previews/<name>.png` (the demo office at a fixed time and time zone, so it only changes when the theme or the renderer does). Look at it: the theme should read well and look different from the others.
3. Add it to the table in the "Theme gallery" section of `plugin/README.md` (and the list in the Turkish part), and commit the JSON and the PNG together. The app's sidebar picker lists it by itself (the JSON ships with the app); for the browser mock, add its name to `GALLERY` in `app/renderer/dev-mock.js`.
